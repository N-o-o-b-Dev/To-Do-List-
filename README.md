To-Do List App üìù
This To-Do List app is a simple, efficient tool designed to help users manage daily tasks effectively. Built as part of my MERN Stack journey, this project demonstrates core functionality with features like task creation, updating, and deletion, using JavaScript and MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN).

Features
Add New Tasks: Users can easily add tasks with just a few clicks.
Mark Tasks as Complete: Stay organized by marking tasks as complete or incomplete.
Edit Tasks: Modify existing tasks to reflect changes.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks to keep your list clutter-free.
Persistent Storage: All tasks are stored in MongoDB, ensuring data persists even after refreshing the page.

React.js for the front-end user interface
Node.js for server-side functionality
