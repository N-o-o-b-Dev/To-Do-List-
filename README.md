# To-Do-List-
This To-Do List app is a simple, efficient tool designed to help users manage daily tasks effectively. Built as part of my MERN Stack journey, this project demonstrates core functionality with features like task creation, updating, and deletion, using JavaScript and MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN).
